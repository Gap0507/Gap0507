# Hi, I’m Garv Shah 

🚀 **Full Stack Developer | Product Lead (CRM SaaS) | Final Year CSE Student**

I’m currently pursuing my **B.E. in Computer Science & Engineering** at **LJ Institute of Engineering and Technology, Ahmedabad** (2022–2026), and alongside academics, I’ve been actively building **production-grade SaaS applications**.

I love taking ideas from scratch and turning them into scalable products — from **designing frontend experiences** in React/Next.js to **architecting backend systems** with Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL.
